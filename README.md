🎮 Project Overview:
I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game where I faced off against an AI opponent. What makes this AI truly special? It not only uses the powerful Minimax algorithm for decision-making but also provides real-time feedback during gameplay! 🤯

🧠 The Minimax Algorithm:
For those unfamiliar, Minimax is a fundamental concept in AI used for decision-making. In this project, the AI player meticulously evaluates all possible moves to ensure it never loses and strives for victory whenever possible. The real-time turn indicator added an extra layer of interactivity to the game.

🏆 And the Winner Is...
At the end of the game, there's an exciting moment when we can see on the output tab who was the winner! — it's the culmination of strategic gameplay and AI prowess.

🎓 Learning and Growth:
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of AI and its applications. I honed my coding skills, explored game theory, and learned how to create interactive experiences that engage users.
